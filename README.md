## sc_install_ubuntu.sh

Simple Sierra Chart install script for Ubuntu Linux.
Currently supports only Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Download and run it as user like a normal shell script.

It installs and configures WINE (staging, development or stable),
creates a WINE bottle and "pours" latest Sierra Chart into it.
